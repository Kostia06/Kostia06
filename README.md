## 🚀 Cool Stuff I've Made

**[Mr. Blu](https://mrblu.com)** - Voice-powered invoicing for contractors. Speak in Spanish, get a professional PDF. Built with SvelteKit, Supabase, and AI. Currently in production.

**[C-137](https://github.com/Kostia06)** - A programming language I designed. Rust-inspired safety + Python-like syntax. Compiler written in C++ targeting LLVM IR.

**[vercelchat](https://github.com/Kostia06/vercelchat)** - Add AI chat to your Next.js app in 5 minutes. Because who doesn't want their website to talk back?

**ShopLocal** - Won 1st place at a 24-hour hackathon by building an e-commerce platform. Fueled entirely by coffee and bad decisions.

**[RGB Bad Apple](https://github.com/Kostia06/RGB_Bad_Apple)** - Bad Apple video but you can't see it when paused. Made sense at 3am, I promise.

**Avatar Motion Capture** - Real-time body tracking with sub-50ms latency. Got 6th place out of 60 teams at RBC Fast Pitch.

**OMG Gaming Platform** - Led 30 people to build online Chess, Connect 4, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Surprisingly, everyone still talks to each other.
