# Hey, I'm Kostiantyn! 👋

CS student at University of Calgary who likes building stuff and breaking things (then fixing them, usually).

## 🎯 Quick Facts

- 🎓 Studying Computer Science (Software Engineering)
- 💼 Built an entire e-commerce site in 6 weeks (yes, I survived)
- 🏆 Won some hackathons, lost even more sleep
- 👨‍🏫 Teaching CS students how to debug their code (and their life choices)
- 📍 Based in Calgary, AB

## 🛠️ I Code In

Python • JavaScript • TypeScript • C++ • Java • PHP

React • Next.js • Flask • PostgreSQL • and whatever else gets the job done

## 🚀 Cool Stuff I've Made

**[vercelchat](https://github.com/Kostia06/vercelchat)** - Add AI chat to your Next.js app in 5 minutes. Because who doesn't want their website to talk back?

**ShopLocal** - Won 1st place at a 24-hour hackathon by building an e-commerce platform. Fueled entirely by coffee and bad decisions.

**[RGB Bad Apple](https://github.com/Kostia06/RGB_Bad_Apple)** - Bad Apple video but you can't see it when paused. Made sense at 3am, I promise.

**Avatar Motion Capture** - Real-time body tracking with sub-50ms latency. Got 6th place out of 60 teams at RBC Fast Pitch. Not bad for a bunch of sleep-deprived students.

**OMG Gaming Platform** - Led 30 people to build online Chess, Connect 4, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Surprisingly, everyone still talks to each other.
